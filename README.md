React Homework

<b>Overview</b>

Create a simple user management application using React. 

Acceptance Criteria

<b>Basic</b>

·         Displays a list of users using JSX

·         Can add and remove users

·         User info includes

o   Address

<b>Advanced</b>

<b>Details</b>

User data should be maintained in the store and modified through actions. It does not have to persist outside of the application (no external JSON files or endpoints necessary).

We’re looking for an understanding of:

<b>Basic</b>
